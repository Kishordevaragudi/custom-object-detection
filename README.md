Object detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or a video. It aims to detect and classify specific objects of interest in a given visual scene. Object detection algorithms typically utilize deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze the contents of an image and predict the presence and location of objects.

The process of object detection involves two primary tasks: object localization and object classification. Object localization refers to determining the precise bounding box coordinates of each detected object within the image. Object classification involves assigning a label or category to each detected object, indicating what it represents or the class it belongs to.

Object detection finds numerous applications across various fields, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, robotics, image search, and augmented reality. It enables machines to understand and interpret visual information, allowing them to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions based on the detected objects in their environment.
